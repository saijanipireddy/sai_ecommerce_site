💡 **Tip:** After adding this README to GitHub, add a **short GIF at the top showing voice commands in action**. Recruiters will see your innovation instantly, even before exploring the live demo.  

If you want, I can also **draft a mini “portfolio-ready” README version** that’s **ultra-short and punchy** for recruiters who skim quickly. Do you want me to do that too?
